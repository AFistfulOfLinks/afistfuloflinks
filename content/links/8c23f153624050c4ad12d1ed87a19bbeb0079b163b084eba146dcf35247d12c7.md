"I\'m Neal Agarwal and I spend most of my time working on neal.fun. It\'s a site where each page is a different creative exploration. Popular pages on the site include one that lets you spend Bill Gates\' money and another one that gives an interactive view into the universe. I also post weird web experiments on Twitter and run a site called Just For Fun that features creative projects on the web."Â
