According to Wikipedia:\
   In statistics, exploratory data analysis (EDA) is an approach to analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often with visual methods. A statistical model can be used or not, but primarily EDA is for seeing what the data can tell us beyond the formal modeling or hypothesis testing task.

\
You can say that EDA is statisticians way of story telling where you explore data, find patterns and tells insights. Often you have some questions in hand you try to validate those questions by performing EDA.
