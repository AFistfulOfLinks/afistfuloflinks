"One of the recurring things that come to bite me and my team is having a less experienced engineer or new joiner work completely alone on a project for weeks or months. We've done this multiple times, and the results were always similarly dire. The engineer ends up building something slightly - or very - different than what we intended to. They took a lot longer to do it - and their morale was down, due to feeling lonely and unproductive this time. They did make mistakes, but did not have anyone give them feedback, to learn from it. Every time we sat down and did a retrospective on what to do different, next time, we agreed on the same thing: have someone to work with from the start."Â
