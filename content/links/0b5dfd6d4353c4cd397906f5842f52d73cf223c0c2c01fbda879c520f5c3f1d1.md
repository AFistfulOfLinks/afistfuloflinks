Code reviews are a popular method of catching bugs early in development through peer-reviewing someone's code. But perhaps more important than catching bugs, these reviews also serve as a chance to see how something is built and have a conversation about it. Because testers question software differently from developers, it's important that we participate in this knowledge-sharing practice.
