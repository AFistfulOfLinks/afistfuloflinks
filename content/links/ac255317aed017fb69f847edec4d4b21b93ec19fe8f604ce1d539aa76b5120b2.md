I recently gave a workshop on \"TDD in Python with pytest\", where I developed a very simple Python project together with the attendees following a TDD approach. It\'s a good way to introduce TDD, I think. I wrote each test together with the attendees, and then I left them the task of writing the Python code that passes the test. This way I could show TDD in action, introducing pytest features like the pytest.raises context manager or the use of assert while they become useful for the actual tests.
