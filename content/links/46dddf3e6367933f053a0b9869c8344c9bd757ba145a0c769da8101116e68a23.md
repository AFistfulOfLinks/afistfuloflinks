GitHub Learning Lab provides hands-on, guided learning experiences to help aspiring and experienced developers learn how to build software, work in teams, and more. We've spent some time focusing on the authoring experience, and we can't wait to show you everything you can do with the improvements we made to Learning Lab."Â
