"Have you gotten around to trying this "serverless" stuff out?

I recently had to scratch my own itch and put together a couple small utilities, one with an AWS Lambda, and the other with an Azure Function.

Have you wondered if one was better than the other?

The experiences were... similar, but also quite different, and thus I share a .NET developer's perspective of each."Â
