My career has meandered its way not into the biological or physical sciences, but into something we're currently calling site reliability engineering -- a strange amalgam of systems administration, performance management, software development, quality control, and the crafting of antifragility, a practice I don't really know what to call other than "applied statistics". In the narrowest view, SRE can be limited to a fancier name for release management, but in most organizations there is runway to make it much more.
