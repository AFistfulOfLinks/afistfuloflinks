I've been programming in Object Oriented languages for decades. The first OO language I used was C++ and then Smalltalk and finally .NET and Java.

\
I was gung-ho to leverage the benefits of Inheritance, Encapsulation, and Polymorphism. The Three Pillars of the Paradigm.

\
I was eager to gain the promise of Reuse and leverage the wisdom gained by those who came before me in this new and exciting landscape.

\
I couldn't contain my excitement at the thought of mapping my real-world objects into their Classes and expected the whole world to fall neatly into place.

\
I couldn't have been more wrong.
