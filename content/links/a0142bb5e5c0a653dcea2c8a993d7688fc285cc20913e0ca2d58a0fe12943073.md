This article series is a guide to modern Python tooling with a focus on simplicity and minimalism. It walks you through the creation of a complete and up-to-date Python project structure, with unit tests, static analysis, type-checking, documentation, and continuous integration and delivery. This guide is aimed at beginners who are keen to learn best practices from the start, and seasoned Python developers whose workflows are affected by boilerplate and workarounds required by the legacy toolbox.
