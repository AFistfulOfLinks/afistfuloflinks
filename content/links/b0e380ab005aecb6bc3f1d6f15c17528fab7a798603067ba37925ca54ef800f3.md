"Who hasn't shaved a yak? Still, the ultimate purpose of programming as a profession or hobby is clear: we want to apply the raw power of computation to a problem, and know that the "recipe" we've written can be trusted to solve the problem we think that it does. Code, in itself, is not an asset. A solved problem is an asset."
