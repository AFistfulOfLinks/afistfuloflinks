One of the most common steps in defining titles when a company is hitting its growth stage is adding 'Senior' to the moniker of engineer but soon enough, especially if retention is good and people are staying on board a number of years, companies realize they need more than just a 2 level engineering ladder. This is where titles like 'principal' or 'staff' engineer become part of the defined career ladder. However, principal engineer should not be seen as a natural progression to senior engineering levels.
