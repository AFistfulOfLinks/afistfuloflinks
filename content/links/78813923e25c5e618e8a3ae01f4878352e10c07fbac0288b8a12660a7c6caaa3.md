In this post, I want to focus on the second of the pillars of object-oriented programming: **delegation**. I will discuss its nature and the main two strategies we can follow to implement it: **composition** and **inheritance**. I will provide examples in Python and show how the powerful OOP implementation of this language opens the door to interesting atypical solutions.
