In the last installment, we ended by asking "Once the tester has learned something about the product, how can you focus a tester's work without over-focusing it?

I provided some examples in Part 4 of this series. Here's another: scenario testing. The examples I'll provide here are based on work done by James Bach and Geordie Keitt several years ago. (I've helped several other organizations apply this approach much more recently, but they're less willing to share details.)

The idea is to use scenarios to guide the tester to explore, experiment, and get experience with the product, acting on ideas about real-world use and about how the product might foreseeably be misused.
