Test case management tools invite managers to manage by (number of) test cases. (...) Managing by test case is as bad as idea as managing programmers by lines of code or number of commits. A programmer’s job is not writing lines of code, even though that is a means he/she uses to achieve their goal. Same for a tester, their job is not executing test cases, but providing information about the quality of the product.
