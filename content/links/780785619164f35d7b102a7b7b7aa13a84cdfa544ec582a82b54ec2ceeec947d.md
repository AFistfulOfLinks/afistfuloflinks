"I hear more voices saying there is little point in doing time-based estimations on how long building software will take, and thus we should just stop doing it. \"Let\'s just use story points and estimate complexity, but not the time\" and \"Let\'s just try \#noestimates\" are suggestions people around me recently brought up. I\'m personally skeptical of both approaches. While I do think that doing time-based estimates is really hard, it comes with so many benefits for those who keep doing it."Â
