What does it actually mean to be 'senior' in this discipline? I certainly have an opinion of what it means, given that I'm charged with hiring, supporting, and retaining engineers whom are deemed to be senior. This notion that there is a bar to be passed in terms of career development is a good one, but I'd also add that these criteria exist on a spectrum, as opposed to a simple list of check-boxes. You don't wake up one day and you are "senior" just because your title reflects that upon a promotion. Senior engineers don't know everything. They're not perfect in their technical knowledge, and they're OK with that.
