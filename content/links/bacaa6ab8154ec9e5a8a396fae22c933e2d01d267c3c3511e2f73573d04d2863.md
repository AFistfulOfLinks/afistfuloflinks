"Python programmers almost never implement the Singleton Pattern as described in the Gang of Four book, whose Singleton class forbids normal instantiation and instead offers a class method that returns the singleton instance. Python is more elegant, and lets a class continue to support the normal syntax for instantiation while defining a custom \_\_new\_\_() method that returns the singleton instance. But an even more Pythonic approach, if your design forces you to offer global access to a singleton object, is to use The Global Object Pattern instead."Â
