This Specialization covers the fundamentals of iOS application development in the Swift programming language. You'll learn to use development tools such as XCode, design interfaces and interactions and evaluate their usability, and integrate camera, photo, and location information to enhance your app. In the final Capstone Project, you'll apply your skills to create a fully-functioning photo editing app for iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch. A Mac computer is required for success in this course.
