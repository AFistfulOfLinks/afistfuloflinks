If your job involves direct leadership of engineering teams, managing how and what they deliver, you've surely come across situations where the pressure to deliver features won out and led to poor service reliability. You've probably had your team's workflow disrupted by interference from senior managers about minor individual issues. Or, you've seen or heard execs questioning your team's planned work to reduce technical debt or improve your delivery processes.

These kinds of clashes are extremely common between engineering teams and management, as well as among different engineering teams. They are all various manifestations of a single issue: the need for a better abstraction layer for people and teams who are trying to interact or collaborate with your team. That abstraction layer is called Service Level Objectives.
