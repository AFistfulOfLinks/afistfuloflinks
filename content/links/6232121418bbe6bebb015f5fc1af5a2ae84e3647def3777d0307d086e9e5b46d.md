For a long time, I have been particularly fascinated with the tickets of bugs, issues, and work that we log on tools like Jira. I\'ve been looking into them in more detail, realizing that they can sometimes be helpful, but more often they are a liability: an excuse to not deal with things, a way to externalize ideas with a significant cost and something any tester is so routinely trained to pay attention to that the change in this requires a whole rewiring of how we deal with things in teams.
