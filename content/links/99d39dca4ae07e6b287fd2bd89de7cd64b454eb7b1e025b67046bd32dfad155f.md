Recently, when I was working with Red Hat Virtualization, I wanted to try to combine the local storage domain of more than one server systems as a Storage Domain in Red Hat Virtualization. After a lot of pondering, I came across the fact that for an Internet Small Computer Systems Interface (iSCSI) datastore I can use multiple backend block storage devices.

So I decided to set up our Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) server to expose about 80% of its local disk over iSCSI to be used for the storage domain backend on the Red Hat Virtualization. In this post, I will go over how I set up iSCSI on RHEL. The steps in this article may apply to CentOS (and, maybe, Fedora) as well.
