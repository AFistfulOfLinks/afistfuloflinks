"In college, a professor's goal is for everyone to learn. At a company, though, the goal is for the business to succeed. Learning, and teaching, are techniques used to reach that goal. It's typically expected that the senior engineers teach as well as learn. So instead of letting those junior engineers figure it out on their own, give them a mentor. With a mentor, their straightforward projects will teach them more and they'll deliver faster, too."Â
