The library I want to introduce to you – python-mockito – is a port of Java’s testing framework with the same name. **It’s safe by default** unlike mock from the standard library. python-mockito has a nice, easy to use API. It also helps you with the maintenance of your tests by being very strict about unexpected behaviours.
