As a manager, hiring is something that you'll be doing a lot of. It sometimes can feel like a drag, especially when the interviews aren't yielding any result. However, getting the right people into the company is essential from both a technical perspective and a cultural perspective, so it deserves your careful attention and time. After all, since you are being judged by the output you delegate through your team, you need to make sure your team has top-notch people.
