A younger, male colleague and I were recently assessing a university unit as volunteers for a professional association. We met with two supervising faculty, an older man (Professor X) and a woman about my age. Throughout the meeting X angled himself toward my colleague, and rarely let the other woman answer any questions. At the end, he asked my colleague questions about his background, but did not ask me, a woman, about mine. What did I do to render myself invisible or less powerful? Does taking notes in a steno pad make me appear to be a secretary? I asked my share of questions, but not the first question. Was that a mistake? Was I right to just let it go and use it as a teachable moment with my students?
