When Sherlock Holmes first meets Dr John Watson, he identifies the physician\'s background at a glance.

One of Conan Doyle\'s mentors at the University of Edinburgh, UK, where he trained as an ophthalmologist, was the surgeon Joseph Bell. And it\'s to him that we owe the famed exchange about Afghanistan, as well as much of Holmes\'s character.
