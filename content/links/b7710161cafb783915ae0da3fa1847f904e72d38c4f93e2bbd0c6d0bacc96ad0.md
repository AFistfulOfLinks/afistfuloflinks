The JavaScript ecosystem continually invents new frameworks and design patterns. These inventions make it a vibrant place to be, but it also creates the need to learn an ever-changing set of code patterns and APIs. Kite's deep learning models have learned all of these patterns, understand the context of your code, so Kite can predict chunks of code and put them in your completions.
