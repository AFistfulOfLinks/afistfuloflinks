An employee comes to you and says, "I have a problem." If you're trying to be a great manager, what do you do?

Your initial instinct might be to roll up your sleeves. "Time to be the boss," you think to yourself. You're ready to step in, solve the problem and save the day.\

Or something like that. You just want to be helpful.\

In reality, your instinct is the opposite of helpful. Startlingly, when you jump in to solve a problem as a manager, it's one of the biggest leadership mistakes you can make.
