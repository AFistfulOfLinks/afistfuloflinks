This blog post is about taking lessons from The Last Dance and applying them to the engineering world. I'll focus on the processes that took place in the Chicago Bulls that converted them from a great team to the best group of their time. A lot can be learned from the different approaches that the coaches took and the different behaviors of Michael Jordan that led to this improvement in the team's performance.
