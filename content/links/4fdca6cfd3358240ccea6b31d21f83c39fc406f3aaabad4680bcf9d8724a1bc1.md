For an upcoming project, I need to extract level data from the classic 1985 video game Super Mario Bros (SMB). More precisely, I want to extract the background imagery for each stage of the game, excluding HUD elements and moving sprites, etc. Of course, I could just stitch together images from the game, and perhaps automate this process with computer vision techniques. But I think the method described below is more interesting, and allows for inspection of elements of the level perhaps not exposed through screenshots.Â
