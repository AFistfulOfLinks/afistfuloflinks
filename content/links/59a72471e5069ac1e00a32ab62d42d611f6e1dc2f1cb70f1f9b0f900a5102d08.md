IPython has a veritable treasure trove of very powerful features. This book wonâ€™t be covering *any* of those. Instead, we are going to explore the interactive shell via the command line that one would typically use in conjunction with Python web development, typically when working with a Django / Flask / Tornado / other Python web framework. We are not going to cover every single feature that is available. We are going to concentrate on the ones that I feel will give you a significant boost in efficiency and usefulness.
