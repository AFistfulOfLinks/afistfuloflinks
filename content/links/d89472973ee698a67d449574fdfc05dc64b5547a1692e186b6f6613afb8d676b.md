"Think about when a manager's helped skyrocket your growth---what did they do? Did they teach you a new skill? Did they give you hard feedback?

9 times out of 10, when I ask this question to groups of workshop attendees, people describe a time when a manager sponsored them for a visible (and often scary) stretch assignment. An assignment that these workshop participants didn't exactly know how to do, and it felt fairly high stakes---but their manager trusted they could do it, for some reason. This trust, and this stretchy project, helped them grow exponentially."Â
