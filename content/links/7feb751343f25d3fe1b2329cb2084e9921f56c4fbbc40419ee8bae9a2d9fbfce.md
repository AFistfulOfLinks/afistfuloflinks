Since starting my own business as a leadership coach, I've spoken with a lot of folks who are at a crossroads in their careers. Should they become a manager, or should they continue to pursue excellence in their craft? Are those paths mutually exclusive? If not, how can they do both?

For many, this can be a very nebulous, stressful decision. There are only a few people I've spoken with who've known without a shadow of a doubt which path they wanted to take (I was not one of them, surprisingly).
