"In April, BBC Culture polled experts around the world to nominate up to five fictional stories they felt had shaped mindsets or influenced history. We received answers from 108 authors, academics, journalists, critics and translators in 35 countries -- their choices took in novels, poems, folk tales and dramas in 33 different languages, including Sumerian, K'iche and Ge'ez."Â
