People that know me will tell you I am a big fan of the SOLID Design Principles championed by Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob). Over the years I\'ve used these principles in C\#, PHP, Node.js, and Python. Everywhere I took them they were generally well-received\...except when I started working in Python. (\...) Since then I\'ve been on a mission to prove SOLID code is Pythonic.
