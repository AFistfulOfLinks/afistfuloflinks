"IT organizations are getting better at change management, but there are still many that "throw projects over the fence" and expect adoption. In some cases, senior business partners accept or even promote this approach. Your enterprise may achieve some success with informal change management, but you'll never realize a project's full business value unless you have buy-in and engagement from the ultimate users. That requires change management."Â
