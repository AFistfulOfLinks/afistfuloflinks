The other day I learned that Ben Frederickson has written an awesome new Python profiler called py-spy!

It takes a similar approach to profiling as rbspy, the profiler I worked on earlier this year -- it can profile any running Python program, it uses process\_vm\_readv to read memory, and it by default displays profiling information in a really easy-to-use way.
