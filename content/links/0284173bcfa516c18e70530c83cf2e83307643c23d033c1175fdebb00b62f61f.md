"If you like classic science fiction, one of the genre's best magazines can now be found online for free. Archive.org is now home to a collection of Galaxy Science Fiction, which published some of the genre's best works, such as an early version of Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 and Alfred Bester's The Demolished Man."Â
