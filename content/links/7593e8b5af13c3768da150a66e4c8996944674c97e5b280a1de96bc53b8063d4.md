Imagine you are a Django developer building a social network for a lean startup. The CEO is pressuring your team for an MVP. The engineers have agreed to build the product using behavior-driven development (BDD) to deliver fast and efficient results. The product owner gives you the first feature request, and following the practice of all good programming methodologies, you begin the BDD process by writing a test. Next you code a bit of functionality to make your test pass and you consider your design. The last step requires you to analyze the feature itself. Does it belong in your app?
