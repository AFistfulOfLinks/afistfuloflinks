My journey as a Software Tester started a bit unexpectedly.

I appeared for the initial interview rounds assuming it to be a Development opportunity. To be honest, like every other Computer Science graduate out there, I was a bit skeptical about going ahead with Testing.

But finally, I decided to give it a try. Only with a hope that my curious nature will help me in this field.

I couldn't accept the offer without putting up this question -- Will I get an opportunity to switch to Development in case Testing doesn't interest me?
