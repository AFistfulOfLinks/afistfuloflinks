Unit testing is a great discipline which can lead to 40%-80% reductions in production bug density. Unit testing also has several other important benefits:

-   Improves your application architecture and maintainability.
-   Leads to better APIs and composability by focusing developers on the developer experience (API) before implementation details.
-   Provides quick feedback on file-save to tell you whether or not your changes worked. This can replace console.log()and clicking around in the UI to test changes. Newcomers to unit testing might spend an extra 15% - 30% on the TDD process as they figure out how to test various components, but experienced TDD practitioners may experience savings in implementation time using TDD.
-   Provides a great safety net which can enhance your confidence when its time to add features or refactor existing features.

But some things are easier to unit test than others. Specifically, unit tests work great for pure functions: Functions which given the same input, always return the same output, and have no side-effects.
