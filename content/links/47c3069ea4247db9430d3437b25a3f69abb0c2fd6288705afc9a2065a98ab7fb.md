In this series so far I've pulled out a couple of Koen's key concepts for attention: sotas and the Rule of Engineering. (...) However, they are cast explicitly for engineers and I'm a tester. I wonder whether, by Koen's intention, they'd apply to me? Are testers engineers? Does testing overlap with engineering? If so, where? If not, why not?
