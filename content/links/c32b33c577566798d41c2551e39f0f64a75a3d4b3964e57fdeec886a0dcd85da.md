Today I want to talk about this mental leap from *ideas* about social reality to *measures* of social reality, and back again to ideas. Whenever I begin to talk about this subject, people say something like, "So you mean how to lie with statistics?" Yes and No. (\...) I will argue, instead, that statistics aren't born with honest meanings that people later corrupt with deceptive packaging. Numbers are figments of our imagination, *fictions* really, no more true than poems or drawings. In this sense, *all* statistics are lies.
