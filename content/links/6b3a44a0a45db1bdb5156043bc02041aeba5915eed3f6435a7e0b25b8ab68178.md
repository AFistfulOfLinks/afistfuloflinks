As testers, we are taught to describe what we observe, the symptoms. Yet the way we are able to frame those symptoms triggers memories and ideas of what the right, proper solution is with the developers. And my new colleague is very right that them doing their job on reporting is not sufficient. They can, and should, work on setting the relationship right so that instead of fixing by symptoms, we fix by causes.
