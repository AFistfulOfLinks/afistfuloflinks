"My kids and I have enjoyed building various structures in the game Minecraft, but it can get rather monotonous placing blocks one-at-a-time. I took a very brief look at the custom "mods" available, but wanted something more compositional, hence the idea for a Haskell DSL was born. The aim is to build a skeleton structure, thereby eliminating the most repetitive parts of manual construction, for example walls, floors, roofs etc. We can then enjoy furnishing the structures by hand in the actual game."
