Here's what you'll learn in this tutorial:

-   You'll learn about several basic numeric, string, and Boolean types that are built into Python. By the end of this tutorial, you'll be familiar with what objects of these types look like, and how to represent them.
-   You'll also get an overview of Python's built-in functions. These are pre-written chunks of code you can call to do useful things. You have already seen the built-in print() function, but there are many others.
