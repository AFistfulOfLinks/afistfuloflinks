Visionary leadership is widely seen as key to strategic change. That's because visionary leadership does not just set the strategic direction --- it tells a story about why the change is worth pursuing and inspires people to embrace the change. Not surprisingly, then, science and practice have a very positive view of visionary leadership as a critical leadership competency.
