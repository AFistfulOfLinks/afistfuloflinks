"My aim is to popularize a result that is well known in the software engineering literature, going back to the early work of Barry Boehm \[1\], and explained with great clarity by Steve McConnell in his 2006 book on software cost estimation \[2\] under the name "Shortest Possible Schedule". While an empirical rather than a logical result, I believe it deserves to be called a theorem (McConnell stays shy of using the term) because it is as close as we have in the area of software engineering management to a universal property, confirmed by numerous experimental studies."Â
