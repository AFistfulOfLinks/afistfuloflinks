The most efficient way to close the stress cycle is physical activity. Walking, running, cycling, dancing, whatever. The second most effective method is breathing exercises. Box breathing, for example, allows CO2 to build up which stimulates the vagus nerve and the parasympathetic system, producing a calm and relaxed feeling. And the third way is positive social interactions and laughter.
