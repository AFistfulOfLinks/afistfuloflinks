The reason this is a survival guide is because after spending my entire career as a software engineer, I was thrown into a team lead role without much warning. I had no idea what I was doing and had very little support. This is the survival guide I wish I had. It documents my experiences as an inexperienced team lead --as an engineer transitioning to a team lead-- and my learnings & mistakes along the way. Hopefully this can act as a survival guide for you, too.Â
