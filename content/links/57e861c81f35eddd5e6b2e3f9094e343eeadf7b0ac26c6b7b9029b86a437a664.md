Do you remember your first F. Scott Fitzgerald? How you realized there was something more to literature, a voice, a time, a glamor? And then you heard about Zelda, and the Jazz Age, and Gatsby, and the beautiful shirts? And thought about why Nick Carraway was named that, and what Scott's life was really like, and whether it would have been amazing or tragic?\
Sally Koslow explored, absorbed, researched and recreated---and brings us---lucky us---a wonderful narrative biography into one part of Scott Fitzgerald's life.
