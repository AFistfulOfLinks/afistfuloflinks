While I didn't post anything on my blog I have been working on a lot of fun projects in my spare time. Most notably, I have been learning Rust. Part of doing that resulted in a few neat side-projects that I will talk about here in more detail. This is mostly my journey on learning a new language, I am sure there are other ways, but this worked for me.
