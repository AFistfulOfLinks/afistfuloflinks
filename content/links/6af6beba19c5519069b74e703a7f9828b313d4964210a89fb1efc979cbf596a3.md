We're often asked: "Can employees at The Ritz-Carlton really spend \$2,000 per day per guest?" The answer is, "yes." At The Ritz-Carlton, everyone has \$2,000/day per guest to make it right or delight, but the money is symbolic. No one is walking around with \$2,000 in his or her pocket. However, from day one at your job, you're encouraged and empowered to fix or improve a guest's experience, and you may spend up to \$2,000 to do this.
