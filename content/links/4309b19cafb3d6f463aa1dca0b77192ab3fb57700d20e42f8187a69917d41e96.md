Using the latest version of Python is always a good idea. (...) Problems start when you work on multiple projects. (...) You could install different Python versions and use the `python3.6`, `python3.7`, `python3.8`, `python3.9` commands. Or maybe even do some crazy setup with symlinks and change what the `python` command points to. But a much better idea is to use a tool called pyenv.
