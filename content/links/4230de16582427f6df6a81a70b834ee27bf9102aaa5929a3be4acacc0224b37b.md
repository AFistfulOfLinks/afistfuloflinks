Back in September 2018, before formal testing phase for Satellite 6.5 started, I was asked to join one of development teams as part of our \"upstream first\" initiative. I was second person in our group to do so. We didn\'t set up objectives or expected outcomes - the goal was to make connections, learn as much as possible and discover what might work for us. After four months, it is time to share my experiences with bigger audience.
