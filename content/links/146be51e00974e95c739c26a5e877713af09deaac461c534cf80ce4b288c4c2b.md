"Puppet has released into public beta its Project Nebula, a cloud native tool that connects a DevOps team's existing toolset into an end-to-end, continuous delivery platform. The company aims to simplify deployment of microservices and serverless-based applications by connecting popular tools for infrastructure provisioning, application deployment, and notifications into a single, automated workflow."
