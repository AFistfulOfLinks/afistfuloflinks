Monkeypatching is dynamically changing a piece of software (such as a module, object, method, or function) at runtime. Monkeypatching is often used for bug fixes or prototyping software, especially when using external APIs or libraries. Pytest uses this feature to allow you to test out interfaces that you don't want to actually execute. For example, you can create a monkeypatched version of the requests module that doesn't do the actual HTTP transactions during testing, but just returns fixed data that you set.
