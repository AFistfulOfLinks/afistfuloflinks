When I was a less experienced developer, I believed in following these "best practices" to the letter, as I thought that would make my code better. I didn't particularly enjoy writing unit tests because of all the ceremony involved with abstractions and mocking, but it was the recommended approach after all, so who am I to know better. It was only later, as I've experimented more and built more projects, that I started to realize that there are much better ways to approach testing and that **focusing on unit tests is**, in most cases, **a complete waste of time**.
