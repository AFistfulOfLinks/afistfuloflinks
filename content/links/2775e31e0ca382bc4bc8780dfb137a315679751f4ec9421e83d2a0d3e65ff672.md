I\'m not against YAML, just against abuse of YAML. I want to help prevent people abusing YAML and being cruel to themselves and their coworkers in the process.

YAML\'s strength is as a structured data format. Yes, it has issues. Whitespace is a minefield. Its syntax is surprisingly complex. It has gotchas: \"Anyone who uses YAML long enough will eventually get burned when attempting to abbreviate Norway.\" But YAML is human readable and supports comments: two key benefits that drive its popularity.

Where it can go wrong is where we use YAML to describe behavior.
