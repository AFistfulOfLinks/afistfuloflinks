"Agasicles, king of the Spartans, once quipped that he wanted to be 'the student of men whose son I should like to be as well.' It is a critical consideration we need to make in our search for role models. Stoicism is no exception. Before we begin our studies we need to ask ourselves: Who are the people that followed these precepts? Who can I point out as an example? Am I proud to look up to this person? Do I want to be more like them?

And Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius, born nearly two millennia ago (121 -- 180), is a leader and example who provides a resounding yes."Â
