I recently wanted a way to quickly jot down things I learn throughout the day, or lessons I want to keep in mind. But that's not enough --- I also need to be able to search these logs so I can find exactly what I'm looking for right away. That's exactly what I'm going to show you how to build today. This project, front-to-back, took me maybe an hour and a half.
