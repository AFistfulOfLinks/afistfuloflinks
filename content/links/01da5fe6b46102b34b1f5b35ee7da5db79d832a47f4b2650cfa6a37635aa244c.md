In this episode, I ask Kelsey all kinds of noob questions such as \"Under what scenarios should I use Docker?\", \"How does Kubernetes relate to Docker?\" and \"Can I borrow your toaster?\" This is a great one for people who, like me, still have a hard time wrapping their head around Docker and K8s.
