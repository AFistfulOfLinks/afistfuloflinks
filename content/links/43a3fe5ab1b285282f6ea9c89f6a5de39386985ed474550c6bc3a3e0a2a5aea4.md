Data-Oriented Architecture is an inversion of the traditional dichotomy between a monolithic binary and data store (monolithic architecture) on the one hand, and small, distributed, independent binaries each with their own data stores (microservices, and service-oriented architecture) on the other. In data-oriented architecture, a monolithic data store is the sole source of state in the system, which is being acted on by loosely-coupled, stateless microservices.
