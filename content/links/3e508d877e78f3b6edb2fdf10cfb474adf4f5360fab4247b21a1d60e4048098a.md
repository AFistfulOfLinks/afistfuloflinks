Over the past year, I have had many conversations with people both inside and outside of Red Hat that always seem to revolve around two questions (much to my dismay and squinty-eyed loosquintyk when asked):

-   Where are we going with Agile in the Products & Technologies division at Red Hat?
-   When is your team going to standardize the process for the entire division so everyone is doing the same thing?
