pip 19.0 has been released on 22nd January 2019. On the feature list most notably it now supports PEP-517, which by default is turned on when that the project has a pyproject.toml at the root folder. The PEP in question has been created in 2015 and accepted in 2017. Even though it took a while until pip implemented it, the release and the issues that followed it up confirmed that many people are not at all familiar with it. Read on if you want to get a picture of how the Python packaging ecosystem evolved as of today and where we hope to see it down the line. We hope even though the introduction of aforementioned python enhancement proposal may cause some discomfort at the moment, we will benefit from it in the long term.
