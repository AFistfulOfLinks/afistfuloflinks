Asynchronous tasks are used to move intensive, time-consuming processes, which are prone to failure, to the background so a response can be returned immediately to the client.

This post looks at how to integrate Celery, an asynchronous task queue, into the Python-based Falcon web framework. We\'ll also use Docker and Docker Compose to tie everything together. Finally, we\'ll look at how to test the Celery tasks with unit and integration tests.
