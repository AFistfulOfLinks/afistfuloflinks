"This Specialization covers the fundamentals of web development with Ruby on Rails. You'll learn everything you need to develop your own web application using Ruby on Rails, SQL and NoSQL databases, and HTML/CSS, and Javascript. We will also touch on advanced topics such as security, services using HTTP/RESTful access patterns, and user access and user experience from multiple device platforms. In the final Capstone Project, you'll apply your skills to develop a web application that hosts uploaded photos and displays them using a map.
