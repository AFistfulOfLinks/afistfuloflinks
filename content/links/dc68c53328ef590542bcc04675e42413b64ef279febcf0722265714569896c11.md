In reflecting on this first decade of getting regularly paid money to type weird symbols into my Terminal, I wanted to take some time to share some of the ways my thinking shifted over the years as a developer.

**For today's junior developers:** Maybe you'll find something here you currently believe, and get inspired to learn more about it and why the topic is so multi-faceted. Or maybe you'll find this post encouraging because you're already so far ahead of where I was at your stage.

**For today's senior developers:** Maybe you can relate, and also have some funny (and humbling) stories to share about your own life lessons when you were a junior dev.
