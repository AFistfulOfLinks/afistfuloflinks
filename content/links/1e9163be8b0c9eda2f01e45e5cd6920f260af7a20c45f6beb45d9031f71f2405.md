Throughout my career, I've developed some opinions. Some have worn particularly deep ruts, reinforced by years of experience. I tried to figure out what these had in common, and it's the idea that code in production is the only code that matters. Staging doesn't matter, code on your laptop doesn't matter, QA doesn't matter, only production matters. Everything else is debt.
