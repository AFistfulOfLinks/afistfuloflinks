Imagine you are looking at your calendar and there is 1:1 session scheduled for 2 PM today. Maybe it is with your manager, or maybe you're a manager about to talk with someone who reports to you. So how do you feel? Happy? Anxious? Neutral? Thinking about losing your time, again? Spending your time well and proactively? Able to push things forward? Competing against...you don't even know what exactly? Complaining once more? Feeling excitement about sharing your recent achievements? Feeling awkward as you don't know what to say? Expecting to get and provide candid feedback?

You can certainly experience a whole mixture of emotions before, during, and after 1:1 meetings. And even if you think you do "quite fine" in this area and know how to have effective 1:1s, we think it could be at least a bit better at Red Hat!
