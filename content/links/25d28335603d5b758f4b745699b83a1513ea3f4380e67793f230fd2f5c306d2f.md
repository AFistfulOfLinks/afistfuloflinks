Regression defects can be the most frustrating thing in the software world.

If you don't know what that means, exactly, or you don't have direct experience with it, let me set the stage for you. Your team has been working on a software release for months. It's been something of a grind, and you've had to cut a few corners to go live by your deadline, but you're going to ship on time. Sure, you anticipate some glitches, but at least you didn't fail to deliver.

You ship the software and, sure enough, reports of glitches do come in. And, as you anticipated, these have to do with the new functionality you developed. Er, some of them do, anyway.

But there are a bunch of other problems besides. And these don't seem to have anything to do with what you shipped. Users are reporting bugs in things that have always worked since the day you've developed them. And they're understandably not happy about this.

These are regression defects.
