Learning is a heavily misunderstood concept.

As a paradigm example of deep work, we understand that, when reading, directing your full attention to the material at hand is essential. Grasping complex information is hard.

But this is only half the battle.

After some string of words hits your retina and made its way to your brain, you're not done.

In a cruel irony, these hours of deep work often cause flow states and the feeling that 'you've had a good day' and learned a shitload of new stuff.

But for many reading episodes this feeling is deceptive. There is an ineliminable aspect to learning that takes place after the glorious flow state.

The other half of the battle is to transfer the newly acquired intelligence from your working memory to your long-term understanding and integrate it into your standing stack of mental models.
