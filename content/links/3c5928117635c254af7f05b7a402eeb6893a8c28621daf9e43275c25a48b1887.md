"There's this idea that, if you do great work at your job, people will (or should!) automatically recognize that work and reward you for it with promotions / increased pay. In practice, it's often more complicated than that -- some kinds of important work are more visible/memorable than others. It's frustrating to have done something really important and later realize that you didn't get rewarded for it just because the people making the decision didn't understand or remember what you did. So I want to talk about a tactic that I and lots of people I work with have used!"Â
