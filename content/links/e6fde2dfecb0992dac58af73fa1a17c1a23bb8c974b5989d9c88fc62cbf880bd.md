"Monolithic, consolidated applications are not bad. These are your Rails apps, your Django apps, etc. --- the ones where your server sends back HTML and assets. You've faithfully followed the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern as best you can and your concerns are "separated." This design principle is not passé. It just so happens that for a long time, it was your only option. For some time now, there has been an alternative. An alternative. Keep calm and don't trash your Django app just yet."
