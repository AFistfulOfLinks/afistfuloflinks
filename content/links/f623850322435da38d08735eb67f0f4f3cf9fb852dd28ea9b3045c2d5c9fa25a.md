During this unprecedented time with the pandemic, many are finding their careers affected. This includes some of the most talented data scientists with which I have ever worked. Having shared my personal experience with some close friends to help them find a new job after being laid off, I thought it worth sharing publicly. After all, this touches more than me and my friends. Any data scientist who was laid off due to the pandemic or who is actively looking for a data science position can find something here to which they can relate, and which I hope will ultimately offer hope in your job search.
