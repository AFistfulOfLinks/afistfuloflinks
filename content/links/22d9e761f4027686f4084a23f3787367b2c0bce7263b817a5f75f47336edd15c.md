Shift-left is an approach to software development where testing is performed earlier in the lifecycle---in effect, moved left on the project timeline. Shifting left does not refer only to dynamic testing, or actually running the system; it also can refer to static testing, so it means conducting reviews and inspections too, as well as more unit and integration testing instead of GUI-based testing.
