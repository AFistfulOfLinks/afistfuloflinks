It (along with a lil `display: grid`) is a fully responsive grid written with no media queries that keeps a good amount of content on screen for everyone no matter their screen size.

The design goal solved here is basically: "I want all these things to be about yay big, but I want them to tile evenly into a row, and I want them to get a little smaller as there's less room on the screen".
