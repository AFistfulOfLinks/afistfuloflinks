Determining which automation tool is *generally* faster is far from simple. Therefore we decided to run our own benchmarks to see how newcomers Puppeteer and Playwright measured against the veteran WebDriverIO (using Selenium *and* the DevTools automation protocols). Among the results of our benchmark were also some **unexpected findings**, like Puppeteer being significantly faster on shorter scripts and WebDriverIO showing larger than expected variability in the longer scenarios.
