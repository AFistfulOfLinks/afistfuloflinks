Virtually everywhere I've ever worked has always been desperate for good engineers. The bottleneck has never been "we don't have enough money to hire as many engineers as we want", the bottleneck is always on the supply-of-good-engineering-candidates side.

Good engineers of course tend to be not only employed but very well paid and well-taken-care-of in just about every way. It seems like most job ads I see these days tout unlimited PTO, catered meals, etc.---things that I never would have dreamed of when I got my first real programming job in 2005 but that are practically table stakes now.

In order to get a good engineer to leave his or her current well-paid and perked-to-the-max job, you have to offer that person something that's somehow better.
