[Last time out](http://www.developsense.com/blog/2019/01/breaking-the-test-case-addiction-part-1/), I was responding to a coaching client, a tester who was working in an organization fixated on test cases. Here, I'll call her Frieda. She had some more questions about how to respond to her managers.

What if they want another tester to do your tests if you are not available?

"'Your tests', or 'your testing'?", I asked.

From what I've heard, your tests. I don't agree with this but trying to see it from their point of view, said Frieda.

I wonder what would happen if we asked them "What happens when you want another manager to do your managing if you are not available?" Or "What happens when you want another programmer to do programming if the programmer is not available?" It seems to me that the last thing they would suggest would be a set of management cases, or programming cases. So why the fixation on test cases?
