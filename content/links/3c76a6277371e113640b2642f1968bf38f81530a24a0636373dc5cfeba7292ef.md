When you're recruiting in a tight talent market, the goal isn't to have every candidate choose you over competitors. A candidate might be a poor match for your company but a great fit for a competitor.

Instead, handle the competition by highlighting your employer's brand, showing candidates what it's like to work at your company. Leave it to the candidate to decide what they want and determine if your company is the right fit. This will filter out the candidates who wouldn't be happy in the role, and will allow you to hire the person who genuinely wants to work at your company.
