Have you ever worked at a company where the same two people always got the most important projects? Me too. It\'s frustrating to watch these opportunities to learn from the side lines, and reliance on a small group can easily limit a company\'s throughput as it grows. This is so important that I\'ve come to believe that having a wide cohort of folks who lead critical projects is one of the most important signifiers of good organizational health.
