Mock is a category of so-called *test doubles* -- objects that mimic the behaviour of other objects. They are meant to be used in tests to replace real implementation that for some reason cannot be used (e.g. because they cause side effects, like transferring funds or launching nukes). Mocks are used to write assertions about the way they are used -- e.g. if they were called, which arguments were used etc.
