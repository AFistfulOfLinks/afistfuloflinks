I wasn't going to write this list. I wasn't going to, but then I mentioned it, half-joking, in the Literary Hub office. Turns out everyone was extremely excited about finding out how tall their favorite writers were (or are). Who knew, right? Anyway, I decided to do it after all. Because it is fun. If you don't think it's fun, well, I don't have to explain my art to you.
