From April 2018 to May 2019 I was the manager of the Data team for GitLab. I took this role after my manager left, when I started reporting directly to the CFO as a Data Engineer. I remember saying to him \"this doesn\'t seem like the right level of abstraction for you,\" and proposed I step up to become the manager. I also said I didn\'t want to do this for a long period of time, since I intentionally came to GitLab to move from a manager role to an individual contributor role and focus on Data Engineering. What follows are a few lessons I learned (and relearned!) in my one-year stint as the manager of the Data team. Eventually, I aim to become a manager again and I hope to remember these lessons and learn even more.
