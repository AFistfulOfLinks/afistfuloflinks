"Who needs a code review? Everybody. It doesn\'t matter if the pull request owner is an intern or the CEO. It doesn\'t matter if the pull request owner has 3 months of experience or 30 years. Development is a delicate task and things can slip through the cracks easily. Having another set of eyes is always beneficial."Â
