In Cuba," reports a coffee compendium published in 1922, "the custom is to grind the coffee fine, to put it into a receiving vessel, and to pour cold water on it. This is repeated many times, until the coffee mass is well saturated. The final result is a highly concentrated extract, which serves for making cafe au lait, or cafe noir, as desired." What this century-old recipe describes, of course, is nothing less than the trendiest drink of the past several summers: cold-brew coffee.
