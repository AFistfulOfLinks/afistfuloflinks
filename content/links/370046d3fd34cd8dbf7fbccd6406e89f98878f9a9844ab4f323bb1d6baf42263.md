"At the recent GUADEC in Thessaloniki, I gave a talk about some strands of work that I've been doing around UX strategy and design/development process. I ended up skipping over some points that I'd wanted to make, and I also had some great conversations with people about the talk afterwards, so I wanted to share an updated version of the talk in blog form."Â
