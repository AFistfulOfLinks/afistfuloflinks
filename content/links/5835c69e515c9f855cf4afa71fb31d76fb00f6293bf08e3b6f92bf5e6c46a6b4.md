In [the previous post](https://www.developsense.com/blog/2019/01/breaking-the-test-case-addiction-part-1/), "Frieda", my coaching client, asked about producing test cases for auditors or regulators. In Rapid Software Testing (RST), we find it helpful to frame that in terms of formal testing.

Testing is formal to the degree that it must be done in a specific way, or to verify specific facts. Formal testing typically has the goal of confirming or demonstrating something in particular about the product. There's a continuum to testing formality in RST.
