This year we decided to conduct a hackathon at the Bangalore Engineering office. We started with the idea of doing something around diversity and inclusion. We adopted the International Women\'s Day theme - \#BalanceforBetter, as it resonated with Red Hat\'s Diversity & Inclusion program. The only rule we applied was that we wanted the participating teams to have at least one woman on their team.
